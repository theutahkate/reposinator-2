# Reposinator 2: Vanilla Style

## Introduction
Reposinator 2 is vanilla JS and CSS, borne of a desire to a) see how quickly I could build this out without the Angular learning curve, and b) correct the UI issues I kept thinking about. Reposinator 2 is deployed on GitHub Pages at [https://theutahkate.github.io/reposinator-2/]

### UI Improvements
I smoothed out the UI so it's more indicative of a UI I would typically build. Changes include:
* Eases the transition to and from the hover state for the buttons
* Adds custom focus styles
* Adds a (very adorable) loader
* Upgrades error messaging
* Allows the user to hide commits
* Adds a VERY IMPORTANT Kitten Mode feature, which displays the most starred repositories with the word "kitten" in them
